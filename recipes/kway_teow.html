            with shrimp, bloody cockles, Chinese lap cheong (sausage),

        <p><h3>Ingredients Required</h3></p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 oz. (30 g) seeded dried red chilies, soak in water</li>
            <li>2 fresh red chilies, seeded</li>
            <li>3 small shallots or pearl onions, peeled and sliced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon oil</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>1.5 tablespoons dark soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
            <li>0.5 teaspoon fish sauce</li>
            <li>0.5 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 dashes ground pepper powder</li>
        </ul>

        <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Grind all the ingredients of the chili paste using 
                a mini food processor until fine. Heat up a wok with 
                1 teaspoon oil and stir-fry the chili paste until aromatic.
                 Dish out and set aside.</li>
            <li>Clean the wok thoroughly and heat it over high flame until 
                it starts to smoke. Add 2 tablespoons oil/lard into the wok
                 and add half the portion of chopped garlic into the wok 
                 and do a quick stir.</li>
            <li>Transfer six (6) prawn out of water and half the sausage 
                slices into the wok. Make a few quick stirs with the 
                spatula until the prawn starts to change color and you 
                smell the aroma of the Chinese sausage.</li>
            <li>Add half the bean sprouts into the wok.</li>
            <li>Immediately follow by 8 oz. or half portion of the flat 
                noodles. </li>
            <li>Add 2 1/2 tablespoons of the sauce into the wok and stir 
                vigorously to blend well. Using the spatula, push the 
                noodles to one side, and add a little oil on the empty
                 area and crack an egg on it. Use the spatula to break the 
                 egg yolk and stir to blend with the egg white. Flip the 
                 noodles and cover the egg, and wait for about 15 seconds.
                </li>
                <li>Add about 1/2 tablespoon of chili paste 
                    (if you like it spicy, add more) and some cockle clams
                     into the wok.Continue to stir-fry and make sure the 
                     egg is cooked through. Add chives, do a couple of 
                     quick stirs, dish out and serve immediately.
