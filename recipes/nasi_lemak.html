        <p><h3>Ingredients Required</h3></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Just like making steamed rice, 
                rinse your rice and drain. Add the coconut milk,
                 a pinch of salt, and some water. Add the pandan 
                 leaves into the rice and cook your rice.</li>
            <li>Rinse the dried anchovies and drain the water. 
                Fry the anchovies until they turn light brown and
                 put aside</li>
            <li>Pound the prawn paste together with shallots, 
                garlic, and deseeded dried chilies with a mortar
                 and pestle. You can also grind them with a food 
                 processor. Slice the red onion into rings. Soak 
                 the tamarind pulp in water for 15 minutes. Squeeze 
                 the tamarind constantly to extract the flavor into 
                 the water. Drain the pulp and save the tamarind juice.</li>
            <li>Heat some oil in a pan and fry the spice paste until 
                fragrant. Add in the onion rings. Add in the ikan bilis
                 and stir well. Add tamarind juice, salt, and sugar. 
                 Simmer on low heat until the gravy thickens. Set aside</li>
            <li>Clean the small fish, cut them into half and season with 
                salt. Deep fry. Cut the cucumber into slices and then 
                quartered into four small pieces. Dish up the steamed 
                coconut milk rice and pour some sambal ikan bilis on top
                 of the rice. Serve with fried fish, cucumber slices, and 
                 hard-boiled eggs</li>
